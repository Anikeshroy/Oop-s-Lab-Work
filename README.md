# Oop's Lab Work üñ•Ô∏è 
## Day 1 to Day 7
This repository contains my solutions and implementations for the Oop's lab work conducted over seven days. The lab work covers a variety of topics , concepts and questions related to C++.

## Lab Structure
The lab work is organized into seven distinct days, each focusing on specific aspects of OOP. The breakdown of topics for each day is as follows:

| SNo | Program Name | Link |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| 01 | Program to use getdata and putdata! | [View Code](https://github.com/Anikeshroy/Oops-Lab-Work/blob/main/Day1) |
| 02 | Program to use private and public access modifier! | [View Code](https://github.com/Anikeshroy/Oops-Lab-Work/blob/main/Day2) |
| 03 | Program to use static function! | [View Code](https://github.com/Anikeshroy/Oops-Lab-Work/blob/main/Day3) |
| 04 | Find cube of any number using inline function! | [View Code](https://github.com/Anikeshroy/Oops-Lab-Work/blob/main/Day4) |
| 05 | Program to use friend function! | [View Code](https://github.com/Anikeshroy/Oops-Lab-Work/blob/main/Day5) |
| 06 | Program to use default argument! | [View Code](https://github.com/Anikeshroy/Oops-Lab-Work/blob/main/Day6) |
| 07 | Program to use call by value and swap numbers! | [View Code](https://github.com/Anikeshroy/Oops-Lab-Work/blob/main/Day7) |

## Structure of the repository
The repository is organized with a separate directory for each lab day. Inside each directory, you will find the C++ source code during the lab sessions.

## Usage
Feel free to explore the code for each day to understand the implementations and solutions to the lab exercises.
